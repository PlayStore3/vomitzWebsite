        <p>Please read the TOS. It’s highly important that you read it. We are NOT responsible for misreading or not reading it at all. The TOS is somewhat WRITTEN WITH AI.








OVERVIEW
SFWatcher is a moderation bot specifically developed to detect and flag users who utilize Not Safe For Work (NSFW) accessories within the Roblox platform. By incorporating SFWatcher into your Discord server or community, you are formally acknowledging and agreeing to abide by its comprehensive Terms of Service (TOS). 










USAGE GUIDELINES
SFWatcher is designed as a moderation tool and will not be tolerated for any form of harassment, doxxing, or targeted attacks against users. Our primary goal is to foster a safe and respectful online environment, and any misuse of the bot that violates this principle will result in immediate action.

User Responsibility for Configuration:

It is crucial for server administrators and users to understand and accept full responsibility for the configuration and any subsequent misconfiguration of the SFWatcher bot on their respective servers. This includes, but is not limited to, setting up appropriate filters, defining alert thresholds, and managing user permissions. Proper configuration is essential for the bot to operate effectively and avoid unintended consequences. Any issues arising from incorrect or negligent setup are solely the responsibility of the server owner or administrator.

Addressing False Positives:

It is important to acknowledge that false positives will occur. SFWatcher, while sophisticated, relies on algorithms and predefined rules, and inevitably, some legitimate content or user interactions may be flagged incorrectly. Therefore, it is an absolute necessity for moderators to always thoroughly review flagged items before proceeding with any action. Jumping to conclusions based solely on a bot's flag can lead to unjust penalties and a negative user experience. Human discretion and critical thinking are indispensable in the moderation process, and the bot should be seen as a helpful assistant, not a definitive judge.


MODERATION
Keywords can affect this system. Be sure MODS change this to logical and fair termsThe automated moderation system, driven by a sophisticated bot, can initiate actions such as banning, kicking, or muting users. These actions are contingent upon the users' equipped accessories, as defined and configured within the system's settings.

It is crucial to recognize that the effectiveness and fairness of this system are significantly influenced by predefined keywords. Therefore, it is imperative that moderators regularly review and adjust these keywords to ensure they are both logical and equitable, thereby preventing arbitrary or unjust enforcement.
